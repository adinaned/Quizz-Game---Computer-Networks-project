A game developed in C using the client-server model for the "computer networks" course in year 2, semester 1. The main objective of the project is to deepen the knowledge of the client-server model and understand the principles of socket and thread.
The game will address to an unlimited number of players who can play in parallel, all of which are managed by a server.
There are a total of 10 questions, which the server will display one by one at every 10 seconds, giving all players enough time to read the questions and make the right choice. If a player misses a question, the server will eliminate that player from the game.
After the game ends, the server will compute the score of each player and display both the individual scores and the name of the winner.
